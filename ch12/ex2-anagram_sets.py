Exercise 2

More anagrams!

    Write a program that reads a word list from a file (see Section 9.1) and
    prints all the sets of words that are anagrams.

    Here is an example of what the output might look like:

    ['deltas', 'desalt', 'lasted', 'salted', 'slated', 'staled']
    ['retainers', 'ternaries']
    ['generating', 'greatening']
    ['resmelts', 'smelters', 'termless']

    Hint: you might want to build a dictionary that maps from a collection of
    letters to a list of words that can be spelled with those letters. The
    question is, how can you represent the collection of letters in a way that
    can be used as a key?  Modify the previous program so that it prints the
    longest list of anagrams first, followed by the second longest, and so on.
    In Scrabble a “bingo” is when you play all seven tiles in your rack, along
    with a letter on the board, to form an eight-letter word. What collection
    of 8 letters forms the most possible bingos?
